It involves authentication, authorization, and user lifecycle management, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific applications and data.</p> <p>IAM helps organizations control user identities and their permissions in a secure and efficient manner. It includes authentication mechanisms such as passwords, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and biometrics to verify users before granting them access. Authorization defines what actions a user can perform, such as read, write, or admin privileges on a resource. Together, these processes mitigate security risks, ensuring that only legitimate users can access sensitive resources.</p> <p>Key components of IAM include:</p> <ol> <li>User Management: Creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts, including roles and permissions.</li> <li>Authentication: Methods like single sign-on (SSO), MFA, and password policies for secure user access.</li> <li>Authorization: Defining roles and access levels to restrict user actions within systems.</li> <li>Identity Federation: Allowing users to log in using credentials from another trusted system, such as social logins or enterprise identity providers.</li> <li>Access Governance: Monitoring and auditing access to ensure compliance with security policies.</li> </ol> <p>A well-implemented IAM strategy enhances security, improves operational efficiency, and ensures compliance with regulatory requirements.

Fault Isolation &amp; Resilience Failures in one microservice do not impact the entire system, ensuring better fault tolerance and graceful degradation through independent service operations. Faster Development &amp; Deployment Parallel development of microservices enables faster release cycles, while CI/CD pipelines streamline deployment without requiring full system redeployments. Technology Flexibility Different microservices can use varied programming languages, databases, and frameworks, allowing teams to choose the most suitable technology for each service. Improved Maintainability &amp; Modularity With each microservice handling a specific function, the codebase remains smaller and more manageable, making debugging and updates simpler. Enhanced Security &amp; Compliance Sensitive data can be isolated within specific services, reducing system-wide security risks, while compliance requirements can be enforced at a granular level. Better Resource Utilization Deployment in containers (Docker, Kubernetes) ensures optimal resource allocation, with targeted load balancing preventing unnecessary overhead. <p>The microservices in Excell Employee ecosystem are discussed here</p>"},{"location":"design/application/iam/","title":"Keycloak","text":""},{"location":"design/application/iam/#background","title":"Background","text":"<p>Keycloak is an open-source identity and access management (IAM) solution that provides authentication and authorization services for applications.
